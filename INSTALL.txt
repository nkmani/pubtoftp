Site adminstration module which helps site admins send static html versions of their sites
to an external web server. This can be very useful if one wants to use Drupal to manage content
but host it on a different server, especially if that server is not capable of having Drupal
installed on it.

Installation
------------
Untar or unzip the downloaded module to your module directory (e.g. sites/all/modules)
and then enable on the admin modules page (/admin/modules).

Requirements
------------
PHP Version > 5.1.2
Need to have the QueryPath module installed (http://drupal.org/project/querypath)

Usage
------
When a node is inserted or edited, at the bottom of the page there will be a "FTP Synchronize" checkbox.
Selecting this checkbox, would ensure that the node is saved to the node author's FTP location as saved
by the administrator in the user's profile page. The html version of the node as well as any needed files
are copied to the FTP server.

Currently the only node type that supports "Publish to FTP" is article. To add additional node types, modify
the following line in pubtoftp.module: 
  define("PUBTOFTP_SYNC_TYPES", "article");

User's FTP Credentials
----------------------
Create 4 fields in the user's profile settings (admin/config/people/accounts/fields) with the following 
field names:

field_ftp_server -- Text
field_ftp_username -- Text
field_ftp_password -- Text
field_ftp_directory -- Text
field_ftp_index -- Integer (holds the nid of the index page)

and enter appropriate values for the user. When the user created FTP sync'able nodes, these credentials
are used to copy the node contents to the server.
