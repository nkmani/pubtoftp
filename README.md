pubtoftp
========

Fork of savetoftp Drupal 7 module to directly publish to FTP locations.

Some enhancements:

- No need for extra dialogs on every node save. Use per user global settings.
- Publish right after a node is created (savetoftp does it only on edit/save).
- Simple .htaccess based support for index file handling.
